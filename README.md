# **Community Detection in Graphs**

#### This package implements community detection in graphs using two widely-used algorithms: _**Girvan-Newman and Louvain**_. 

It offers a menu-driven interface that enables users to generate random or regular graphs, analyze their properties, and visualize detected communities.
By leveraging graph theory, modularity optimization, and edge betweenness centrality, the package provides insights into the structure of networks and includes metrics such as _connectedness, bipartiteness, chromatic number, diameter and graph density_.
This program offers a practical introduction to community detection, showcasing the strengths of modularity-based and edge-removal algorithms while providing a visual exploration of complex network structures.
